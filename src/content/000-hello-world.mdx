# Hello World

I am Stanley. If you somehow landed here, hi.

This is the first post to this blog, which, after a long time, I finally had time to finish it.

I'll also be porting over my old articles here. If you find articles older than this one, you now know why.

I also made the theme and all the components on this site. You can grab the base theme for shadcn/ui from [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/themes/cmhnece4p000c04l85sxb2rvn). And play with most the components on the [design system](/design-system) page.

If you want to know more about me, you can check out the [about](/about) page.

Following this, I'll be writing more on what I discovered and learned fiddling around various technologies.
