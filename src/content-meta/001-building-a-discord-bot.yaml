  Who's building a Discord chatbot in 2025?

  Precisely because it's 2025! Look at what we've got:

  * Large language models
  * Convenient and mature Web techs
  * A lot of tooling around LLMs (tool calls, MCPs)

  You are just one frontend away from building your own chatbot! However, supporting streaming server-sent events without everything exploding and maintaining accessibility anywhere is quite a frontend challenge. What if I tell you, there is a way, without writing a single line of frontend code, you can get a perfect chat interface with cross-platform and mobile support? Yes! It's Discord!
