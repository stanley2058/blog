  Tools are what bridge LLMs and other non-text entities.

  For example, the model itself cannot extract the content of a link, so how does the model obtain the content of the link you pasted in ChatGPT? Actually, the model is calling a tool behind the scenes, which fetches the content and adds it to the context.

  After this, the model can generate a response based on the correct context!
